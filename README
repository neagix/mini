# MINI - Mini is Not IOS

This is a modified version of MINI for Wii; its logic has been altered to work like this:

* if `/bootmii/zImage` exists, attempt to launch it
* if it does not exist or fails, repeat for `/bootmii/gui.elf`
* if it does not exist or launch fails, run `/bootmii/ppcboot.elf` (original behaviour as fallback)
* if all paths have failed, run System Menu

MINI -- Mini Is Not IOS
Copyright (c) 2008, 2009 Team Twiizers

mini is our bare-bones replacement for IOS.  It does not have all of
the features that IOS provides -- notably, we have not implemented
USB, networking, write support to the NAND filesystem, DI support or
WC24 support.  However, all hardware is directly accessable via IPC --
see mini_ipc.c/h for details.

Please feel free to add write code to fill in gaps in the
functionality.  As it stands, it's useful for low-level system
recovery tasks, and as a shim/proxy to allow code on the PPC
(e.g. Linux) to have full access to the Wii's hardware.
